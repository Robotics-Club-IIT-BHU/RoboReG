You can map any world using this project. Just replace the new_world in 3D-Occupancy-Maps-With-Quadrotors/drone_test/worlds and rename it new_world.
You can create the occupancy map of your gazebo world.

Project Comprises of -

Our Package : We created a ROS package with necessary dependencies. This package serves the purpose of linking Hector Quadrotor and Octomap with appropriate remapping of topics. We start our drone with this package.

Hector Quadrotor : We chose to simulate our project using the Hector Quadrotor due to its huge functionality. This drone is equipped with a depth camera and kinect. Moreover, it's extremely popular and used across various projects.

Octomap : The point cloud data published is not always accurate and there are variances. The OctoMap package estimates the inaccuracies and  corrects them by establishing continuity in the probability function.
